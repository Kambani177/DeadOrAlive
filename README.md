# DeadOrAlive
#The program runs an alternate version of the blackjack card game
#The game works like in the following: Player and Dealer draw a card, the higher rank wins. If the
ranks are equal, the order is given as in SUITS: spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs. 
#The program counts the number of wins and loses and runs until the deck of cards is empty.
